**The work on Overthrow continues!**

Overthrow: Community Edition is a continuation of the Overthrow Plus project by **Nifnat**: https://github.com/Nifnat/Overthrow

The goal of the project is to update the Overthrow codebase to allow for easier modification and enhanced performance, while also adding new features, trying to stay faithful to the original vision of Overthrow.
